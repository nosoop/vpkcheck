# vpkcheck
Checks for overlapping files in VPKs.

## Usage

Requires the vpk library (update if necessary):

	pip install [--user] [--upgrade] vpk

Download and run the script:

	vpkcheck.py [options] [files...]

The following options are valid:

* `-m <directory>` Path to the game mod directory (with `gameinfo.txt` and `steam.inf`)
* `-l <addon list>` Path to a list of addons generated by [Steam Workshop Content Downloader][ws]
&mdash; optional, only required to get the addon name
* `-p <base package>` Path to a base VPK package to check against
* `files` A set of files.

If a game directory is specified, the script will attempt to detect the base package, find an
addon list at `addons/workshop/addon.lst` and will check all VPKs under the `addons` directory.
(Only L4D2 has base package detection at the moment.)
